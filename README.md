## Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
I am currently taking a Udemy course on Data Science and Machine Learning. I took this course back in 2018, but it would be a good opportunity to review it since it provided a solid foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

The course outline includes
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pyplot
6. Geo-plotting and Choropleth
7. Scikit Learn
8. Linear Regression
9. Logistic Regression
10. Randon Forest
11. Decision Tree
12. Principal Component Analysis - PCA
13. Natural Language Processing - NLP
14. Deep Learning
15. Artificial Neural Networks - ANN


I will update course details as soon as I complete each section. Expected to complete the course on 12th August 2026.
