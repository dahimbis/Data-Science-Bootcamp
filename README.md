## Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
I am currently taking a Udemy course on Data Science and Machine Learning. I took this course back in 2018, but it would be a good opportunity to review it since it provided a solid foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

The course outline includes
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pyplot
6. Geo-plotting and Choropleth
7. Scikit Learn
8. Linear Regression
9. Randon Forest
10. Decision Tree


I will be updating course details as soon as I finish each section. Expected to complete the course on 12th August 2026.
