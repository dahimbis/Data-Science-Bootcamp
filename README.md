## Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
I am currently taking a Udemy course on Data Science and Machine Learning. I took this course back in 2018, but it would be a good opportunity to review it since it provided a solid foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

The course outline includes
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pyplot
6. Geo-plotting and Choropleth
7. Scikit Learn
8. Linear Regression

10. Randon Forest
11. Decision Tree
12. Principal Component Analysis - PCA
13. Support Vector Machines - SVMS
14. Natural Language Processing - NLP
15. Deep Learning
16. Artificial Neural Networks - ANN
